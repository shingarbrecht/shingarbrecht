Hi, my name is Shin. 🌸 Since I was little, I have always been passionate about technology. I used to live in both China 🇨🇳 and Japan 🇯🇵 and have now moved to America 🇺🇸 as a permanent resident to pursue my dream of working full-time as a Software Engineer! 👩‍💻

 I’ve gained my knowledge and skills from a computer science minor 📚, software engineering bootcamp 🥾, extensive self-study, and freelance work as a developer. Through this experience I am highly capable to work as both a front-end or back-end software engineer. 

Before working in software engineering, I earned my MBA in Business Design 💼 at Josai International University in Tokyo, Japan, and had a successful career in sales, becoming the lead salesperson at my company. I am excited to bring my passion for technology and teamwork as a full-time software engineer. 😊✨
